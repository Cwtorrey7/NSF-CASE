# NSF-CASE

### Notes from Mia
* Typically the public/ folder contains the assets (pictures and such). The src/ folder will hold all the code.
* Add any files you do not need tracked to the `.gitignore` file. 
* Link to repo of JavaScript library I'm using for simulating terminal: [xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js)
* Using official Michigan Tech colors link [here](https://www.mtu.edu/umc/resources/brand/#palette)

### Existing bugs
* Ran into some issues with bash scripts appending `\r` at the end of everyline.
