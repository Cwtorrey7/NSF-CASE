                                In May of 2017, the ransomware worm known as WannaCry infected numerous
                                organizations, causing significant damage. Over 200,000 systems were infected across
                                150 countries, with damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Prominent victims of
                                WannaCry included Boeing, Honda, the NHS of England and Scotland, and the
                                University of Montreal. The ransomware demanded a $300 Bitcoin payment in
                                exchange for the decryption of the victim's files, with the amount increasing over time if
                                left unpaid. On the same day of WannaCry's release, a hardcoded kill switch was
                                discovered and promptly registered by a security researcher. While this did not help
                                systems already infected, it effectively halted further spread of WannaCry within a
                                matter of hours.

                                WannaCry used the previously undisclosed EternalBlue vulnerability
                                (CVE-2017-0144), which takes advantage of SMBv1 mishandling specially crafted
                                packets, allowing for remote code execution.
                                A backdoor implant tool known as DoublePulsar is also used. The tool is able to
                                run in system memory, allowing it to stealthily install malware on the host.
                                Both EternalBlue and DoublePulsar were believed to be originally developed by
                                the NSA, and later stolen by the hacking group known as The Shadow Brokers,
                                meaning they were not publicly known. Such vulnerabilities are called “Zero Days”,
                                referring to the amount of days the vulnerability's existence has been known. Since
                                previously unknown, security professionals have to begin developing patches the same
                                day of release.
