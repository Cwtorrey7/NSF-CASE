                                    Anthem, one of the largest health insurance providers, was revealed to have been breached in 2015 as hackers gained access to the health insurer's database. Personal information of nearly 80 million individuals, including current and former customers and employees was leaked. The attackers executed a sophisticated spear phishing campaign to compromise employee credentials, allowing them to gain access to Anthem's network and exfiltrate data. The stolen information included names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and medical data, raising concerns about identity theft and privacy violations. The incident exposed the vulnerability of healthcare organizations to cyber threats highlighted and the importance of proper cybersecurity measures to protect patient information.

                                    The group “Deep Panda”, responsible for the Anthem breach, utilized advanced techniques, such as targeted spear phishing campaigns and a novel attack framework written in javascript. The term APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) refers to a skilled and determined adversary with advanced capabilities.

                                    Hackers posed as Anthem’s HR and IT services within emails, and used typosquatting to create fake and malicious websites resembling legitimate domains. The phishing emails contained malicious attachments and embedded links leading to these typosquat domains, myhrsolutions.we11point.com and extcitrix.we11point.com. Once opened, the malware exploited various capabilities, including establishing backdoor channels, executing files and commands, and collecting and sending information about the infected computer.

    <div id="terminalDescription" style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; color: white;">In this lab, we will examine typosquatting, a very common technique used by attackers to phish for credentials. You will search for popular websites and analyze their various typosquatted domains.

Instructions:
<ul>
<li>Use the <code style="color: rgb(255, 215, 0);">help-module5</code> command to explore available commands.</li>
<li>View the various typosquatted domains of twitter.com</li>
<li>View the various typosquatted domains of google.com</li>
<li>Examine the different typo types used by attackers</li>
<li>Examine the nameservers of the typosquatted domains</li>
<li>In Google.com’s domain report, a majority of the typosquatted domains seem to belong to Google. Think about why this is the case</li></ul></div>
