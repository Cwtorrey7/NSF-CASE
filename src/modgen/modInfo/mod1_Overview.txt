In May of 2017, the ransomware worm known as WannaCry infected numerous
organizations, causing significant damage. Over 200,000 systems were infected across
150 countries, with damages in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Prominent victims of
WannaCry included Boeing, Honda, the NHS of England and Scotland, and the
University of Montreal. The ransomware demanded a $300 Bitcoin payment in
exchange for the decryption of the victim's files, with the amount increasing over time if
left unpaid. On the same day of WannaCry's release, a hardcoded kill switch was
discovered and promptly registered by a security researcher. While this did not help
systems already infected, it effectively halted further spread of WannaCry within a
matter of hours.
